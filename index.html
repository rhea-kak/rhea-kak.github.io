  <p>I am currently a senior at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science in the College of Engineering. 
    My interests lie in software engineering <br>and desgining technology for social impact.
  Welcome to my page, I'm glad that you're here!</p>

  <p>Professional Interests: I am passionate about technology that creates a real and positive impact.
    As a Software Engineer, I'm always striving to learn more about tech for social good and I constantly seek out opportunities to apply my skills to
    real-life situation to help myself and others! My most recent pursuit in social justice is helping to end mass incarceration by working with Recidiviz, 
    a company that partners with state criminal justice agencies to advance their use of data and reduce incarceration.
  </p>

  <p>Personal Interests: When I'm not pursuing the next tech for social impact project, you can find me anywhere outdoors! 
    I love spending as much time outside and moving, whether that's hiking, running, or my favorite, skiing.
    I have also been dancing since I was 5, and have continued throughout college. I hope to keep pursuing my love for dance even after I graduate!
  </p>
