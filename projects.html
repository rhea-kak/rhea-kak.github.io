  <h2 class="title">Playful Plants</h2>
  <p class="description">For this project I designed and implemented a fully featured media catalog for the members of Playful Plants, a research group at Cornell. I enacted user access controls for the admin and consumer views, thus preventing unauthorized users from modifying records and included functionality for tagging, uploading, sorting, filtering, editing, and deleting catalog entries using SQLite, PHP,
    HTML, and CSS. This provided users with maximum customization abilities.</p>

<div class="box">
  <img src="images/dice.png" alt="Sorry!">
  <h2 class="title">Sorry!</h2>
  <p class="description">This project involved collaborating with 2 other engineers to develop an OCaml-based game that resembles the popular board game "Sorry!". We scheduled weekly meetings with our PM to ensure that all expectations were met, while also incorporating any feedback given. 
    We also supported both multi-player and CPU modes, and utilized GUIs and design principles to create an appealing interface.</p>

<div class="box">
  <img src="images/spotify.png" alt="Spotify API">
  <h2 class="title">Spotify API</h2>
  <p class="description">For this project I created a bot that leverages the Spotify API to allow a user to automatically save the personally curated "Discover Weekly" playlists that are generated by Spotify. This solves the issue of not being able to recover them once they are refreshed each week.
