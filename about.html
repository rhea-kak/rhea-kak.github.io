  <h1> About Me</h1>
  <p>I am currently a senior at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science in the College of Engineering.<br>
    My interests lie in software engineering and desgining technology for social impact.<br>
  Welcome to my page, I'm glad that you're here!</p>

  <h2>Professional Interests</h2>
  
  <p>I am passionate about technology that creates a real and positive impact.<br>
    As a Software Engineer, I'm always striving to learn more about tech for social good <br>and I constantly seek out opportunities to apply my skills to
    real-life situation to help myself and others!<br> My most recent pursuit in social justice is helping to end mass incarceration by working with Recidiviz, <br>
    a company that partners with state criminal justice agencies to advance their use of data and reduce incarceration.
  </p>

  <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
  
  <p>When I'm not pursuing the next tech for social impact project, <br>you can find me anywhere outdoors! 
    I love spending as much time outside and moving, <br>whether that's hiking, running, or my favorite, skiing.
    I have also been dancing since I was 5, and have continued throughout college. <br>I hope to keep pursuing my love for dance even after I graduate!
